# Recognition of Handwritten English Characters

## Task Description

This project is a part of my bachelor graduation design. The task is to correctly identify English characters (uppercases, lowercases, and digits) based on 1-channel visual input. 

## My Objective

Everyone knows this is trivial task using state-of-the-art technology. Yet, my advisor picked this task and I have to finish it. Since there is very little challenge, I decide to take this project as a chance to practice version control.

In the meanwhile, I would like to set up this project in a docker container in the future, which is something I have not tried before.

## Instructions on Running the Codes

1. Kindly download the 800 MiB [dataset](http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/vip/cs_links/EMNIST/matlab.zip) in .zip form.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Rename the unzipped folder to `dataset` and move it under the parent directory of this project.

The last part is not necessary if you insist on using a different path or folder name. However, relevant changes must be made to the args passed to the program. Otherwise, the default option is to look into a `dataset/` subfolder under the project root.

## ETA

Although the deadline is May 2019, the project is such a trivial task that I plan on finish it within a few days. However, due to the number of final examinations I have in future weeks, there might be some delay.
